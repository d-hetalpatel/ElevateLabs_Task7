Use SVMs for linear and non-linear classification.
# SVM Binary Classification Task

## Task Overview
This task demonstrates the workflow of training and evaluating a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for a binary classification task. The main goals are to explore different kernels, visualize decision boundaries, and tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

---

## Features
1. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Load and clean a dataset suitable for binary classification.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Standardize features for better SVM performance.

2. **SVM Training**
   - Train SVM with **Linear Kernel**.
   - Train SVM with **RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel**.

3. **Decision Boundary Visualization**
   - Visualize SVM decision boundaries using 2D data.
   - Compare linear and non-linear decision surfaces.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Tune `C` (regularization) and `gamma` (for RBF kernel) to optimize model performance.
   - Use grid search or manual experimentation.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use cross-validation to evaluate SVM performance.
   - Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
